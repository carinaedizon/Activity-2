 <h1>INTRODUCING THE ONE AND ONLY ME</h1>  
 <h2>HELLO! IM ETA CARINAE V. DIZON</h2>
    <p>
        <br>I'm just a simple girl with simple dreams. My name is Eta Carinae V Dizon, and I believe that life's beauty often 
        <br>lies in its simplicity.I'm not one for extravagance or grandiose gestures; instead, I find joy in the small, everyday 
        <br>moments that make life special.I was born and raised in Pagudpud, Ilocos Norte at brgy. Pasaleng, and I appreciate the 
        <br>quiet charm of my hometown. I've always valued the  the importance of family, and spending quality time with loved ones 
        <br>is something I hold dear. In my free time, you'll likely find me listening to music, enjoying nature, or watching K dramas. 
        <br>There's something magical about the simplicity of these activities that brings me immense contentment.The two most important 
        <br>person of my life is ofcoures my parents my father is Pepito P. Dizon and my Mother is is Arceli V. Dizon. I also feel blessed 
        <br>because i have four siblings two brothers and two sisters and I am the youngest.Im a shy type girl since i was a kid and 
        <br>Im not used to socialize with many people thats why i just have few friends. Im not into sport and Im not active in school 
        <br>activities like dancing and singing. I think theres nothing more intereting about me but I think what makes me unique is that 
        <br>I am being me.I finish my junior and senior high school at my beloved almamater Pasaleng National High School and luckily i pass 
        <br>the college entrance examination of MMSU where i am currently studying.In five years, I see myself as a college graduate, working 
        <br>in a job I'm passionate about.I aim to be financially stable, independent, and continuously learning. I envision building a strong 
        <br>network and possibly furthering  my education or career advancement. Personally, I want to maintain a healthy work-life balance, 
        <br>spending quality time with family and friends,and pursuing my hobbies.
